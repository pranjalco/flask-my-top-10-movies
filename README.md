# My Top Movies
This is a Flask-based movie ranking app that allows users to manage their favorite movies in a database. Users can search for movies using an API, add them to their list with a rating and review, and update or delete them as needed. The app provides full CRUD functionality, ensuring seamless data management. Additionally, movies are displayed in a sorted list based on ranking, and the interface is styled with Bootstrap for a clean user experience.
